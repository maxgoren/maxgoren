- Hi, I’m @maxgoren thanks for stopping by!
- I’m interested in compilers and programming language design and development.
- I'm also keenly interested data structures and algorithms, in particular high performance search structures and balanced search trees.
- I work as a Backend Software Engineer in Boston, MA developing mostly Java Springboot applications.
- I maintain a blog for all things software engineering at http://www.maxgcoding.com and much of what is hosted here is originally discussed there.
