- 👋 Hi, I’m @maxgoren thanks for stopping by!

-    Main Tech stacks:
-               Personal: Modern C++ (SDL2, STL, bearlibterminal), Perl 5, Java
-               Professional: Java with Springboot/JPA/Hibernate and MySQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any thing if the project tickles my interest, reach out! Aside from my personal interests, I have backend development experience with Java Springboot with Hibernate and MySQL.
